# bryce\_natter\_website

The website is live at [natter.fun](https://natter.fun). I used this portfolio-type website to learn the basics of React before working on a more involved project. It also gave me an opportunity to learn how to set up an Apache web server and learn about ssl certificates. The most useful piece of code to come out of this project are the GitHub card components which can be found in the project files.
